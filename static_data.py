Many of these laws have an impact on the way apparel and accessories businesses operate by requiring them to decrease pollution or control waste. As a result, apparel and accessories businesses often need to spend money to comply with the rules and regulations, which leads to an increase in operating costs. For example, an apparel and accessories business might need to purchase pollution-control devices.

Governments develop laws to monitor and regulate distribution activities so that individuals and businesses operate in a consistent, fair manner. When a channel member attempts to reduce competition, it may be violating certain laws. One activity that may reduce competition is an apparel manufacturer closing a sales territory in order to keep its competitors from obtaining access to the market.

If the channel member does not tell the producer about the sales promotion, it may not produce enough products to send to the channel member to sell to the end users. Transporters (e.g., trucking companies) do not usually need to hire order takers for another channel member's sales promotion. Although advising the producer about a sales promotion may reduce inventory stock-outs, the risk cannot be eliminated. Inventory shrinkage is the loss of inventory due to shoplifting, employee theft, breakage, misplaced goods, or poor recordkeeping.",

The damages could involve a substantial amount of money, which could have a negative affect on the business's reputation and profitability.

A business should make sure that it develops and enacts a public-relations action plan in case a lawsuit generates negative media attention about the business.

Many people decide what their financial needs or goals are in the future, and then invest in the types of life insurance policies that will meet those needs. Disability insurance, rather than life insurance, provides income to those who become disabled. Certain types of health insurance will pay for private health care.

In some cases, businesses know they will be short of cash and make arrangements to borrow funds to cover the necessary expenses. In this example, the business must pay salaries of $27,500 and commissions of $12,250 for a total of $39,750 ($27,500 + $12,250 = $39,750). However, the business expects to have only 75% of that amount so will be 25% short.

Businesses also need to compare the performance measures to financial outcomes to determine if the activity was worth the cost. The click-through rate for online advertising is a performance measure. By analyzing the click-through rate, businesses can link performance to financial outcomes. For example, if 200,000 people viewed a site and 8,000 of them clicked on a banner ad, the click-through rate is 4%. If the goal was to achieve a click-through rate of 2%, the activity outperformed expectations that might lead to an increase in sales, which is the financial outcome the business desires.

When a restaurant extends its operating hours, it must pay the employees to do the work. Therefore, the cost associated with extending business hours is the payroll expenses. Increased sales volume, higher profit margins, and increased customer satisfaction are benefits associated with providing the service.",

Channel members are all of the businesses and individuals who assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the customer. For the products to move efficiently through the distribution system, it is important for all channel members to clearly communicate with each other. For example, if a retailer plans to promote a specific item on a specific day, it must advise the producer or wholesaler to make sure that the items are available on the day of the promotion for customers to purchase. For maximum efficiency, channel members should adopt an interdependent rather than an independent mindset. Sanctions are not always necessary to coordinate marketing activities.

	    "explanation": "Territories. Dividing an area into geographic units is one way of establishing sales territories. A state is a common geographic unit that is easy to identify. For example, a technical business might have a salesperson in Ohio who is responsible for servicing the surrounding states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan. Another salesperson might be in New York and cover the New England states. The goal of businesses often is to try to divide areas so that salespeople have comparable accounts and equal opportunity to earn an income. When businesses divide areas into geographic units, they are not establishing sales objectives, departments, or schedules.",

	    "explanation": "To find out if products are selling. A business plan is a proposal of how a business intends to operate to achieve its objective. It is important for an electronics firm to track the performance of its business plan to determine if the objective of the firm is being met. A main objective for most businesses is to sell products. By tracking the performance of the strategies outlined in the business plan, an electronics firm is able to find out if strategies it is using to sell are effective. If the electronics firm is not satisfied with the level of sales, it might develop different strategies. Developing a business plan involves establishing an operating strategy and determining the proposed mission of the company. Businesses often use a business plan to provide investment information to potential investors.",
